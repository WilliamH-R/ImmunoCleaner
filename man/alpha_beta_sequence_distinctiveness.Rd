\title{Bar plot showing distinctiveness of the alpha- and beta chains}
\usage{
alpha_beta_sequence_distinctiveness(.data, identifier = barcode)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An prepared data frame ready for modelling.}

\item{identifier}{A variable in the data frame with which the data set should
be distinct by to avoid a bias towards experiments with many observations.}
}
\value{
Returns a bar plot with the relative distinctiveness of all alpha
and beta chains. A lower value means less distinctive sequences
compared to the total number of that chain.
}
\description{
\code{alpha_beta_sequence_distinctiveness()} takes as input a prepared data frame. Firstly,
the total number of alpha- and beta chains are calculated respectively.
This is done by grouping on \code{identifier} (i.e. experiments) and making
\code{TCR_sequence} distinct and then counting. Secondly, the number of different
alpha- and beta chains respectively is counted. This is done by making them
distinct without grouping. The distinctiveness is then calculated as
number of unique divided by total number of chains, statified on chain type.
